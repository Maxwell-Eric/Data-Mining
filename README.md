## This project creates an IB2 classifier and a LED7 Generator then installs it into the WEKA workbench. 
The IB2 classifier was then compared to the IB1 and J48 classifiers with the LED24 and LED7 data generators with varying amounts of noise.
The IB2 report details the process and results of the experiment with respect to classification accuracy and data storage.
